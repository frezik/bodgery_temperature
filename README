Logs temperature to a database over a simple HTTP API.

The API call is:

    POST /temp/:room_id/:temp

Where `:room_id` is a unique ID for each sensor, and `:temp` is the 
temperature in celsius.

It works off an ESP8266 and a TMP102 sensor.  See `PINOUT.txt` for how to 
wire it up. I suggest using the NodeMCU board for the ESP8266, and the 
Sparkfun breakout board for the TMP102. You'll also need a USB power 
adaptor that can provide at least an amp or so. Anything that is recommended 
for use on a Raspberry Pi should be fine.

See `mount.svg` for a laser-cuttable mount for attaching everything to a wall. 
It's sized to fit the suggested boards above.
